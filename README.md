# multi-stage-linear-BJT-amplifier

design and simulate a multi-stage, linear BJT amplifier to drive a 4 ohm speaker at 10
W of RMS power. The signal source is sinusoidal, oscillating at 1 kHz with a peak voltage of 5 mV for
a transient simulation and a peak voltage of 5 mV with variable frequency for a frequency sweep
simulation, and an output resistance of 100 . The load is a speaker which can be modeled as a 4 Ω
resistor. For the BJT transistors, use the 2N5210 for the common emitter amplifier stages and generic
NPN and PNP BJTs for the Darlington pairs of the Class AB push-pull amplifier. All of the
aforementioned BJT transistors can be found in the LTSpice library.
